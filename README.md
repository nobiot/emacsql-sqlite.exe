# emacsql-sqlite.exe
Binary emacsql-sqlite.exe for Windows.
This is purely for convenience for [Org-roam V2](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam) users who have trouble compiling emacsq-sqlite.exe on Windows on their own.

I do not guarantee that it works for every Window machine. It is provided as is, and I will assume no responsibility if it does not work for you. I will not respond to any request for support.
